Week 5 UW coding bootcamp Homework
Instructions:
- You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

PSUDOCODE:

- the countdown timer will be on the top of the page counting down from 3 minutes(90 seconds)(9000).
- there'll be a total of 3 screens: 
    - first screen- intro statements about the game,
